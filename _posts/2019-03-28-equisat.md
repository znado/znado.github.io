The undergraduate space engineering <a href="https://brownspace.org/" target="_blank">team</a> I was a part of built a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/2576.html" target="_blank">satellite</a> for $4000 which acts as an artificial shooting star. <a href="http://equisat.brownspace.org/" target="_blank">EQUiSat</a> is now alive and well in space!

  <p>Before I embark on this adventure of a post I’d like to thank the many people that made this possible: Tyler Fox, Ryan Izant, and Mckenna Cisler (CHECK, links?) for answering many questions and reviewing this post; our awesome mentor Rick Fleeter, whose decades of space experience helped guide us and whose many friendly contacts answered our many questions; the Brown Engineering department, whose facilities and staff helped make this dream into reality; the University Sapienza of Rome for hosting one of our ground stations; the Rhode Island Space Grant, whose funds and support enabled our growth and success as a team; NASA, whose infrastructure and initiatives made all of this possible; Nanoracks, our integration provider; <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/W9GYR">Mike Umbricht</a> from the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Physics/Ladd/">Ladd Observatory</a> at Brown University who helped with our radio <a target="_blank" href="https://blogs.brown.edu/umbricht/tag/spaceflight/">comms</a> and Providence ground station; the HAM Radio community and <a target="_blank" href="https://satnogs.org/">Satnogs</a>; and of course all our <a target="_blank" href="http://brownspace.org/sponsors/">sponsors</a>, alumni, and friends who donated and otherwise helped to make this project possible.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>One day in the fall of 2013 during my sophomore year in college, I was walking around the engineering building, and happened to look up at the TVs that played student and department announcements. I saw a call for students to join a growing engineering team and thought I’d go check it out. I was, unknowingly at the time, making one of the best decisions of my life. This is how I joined the Brown Space Engineering team (link https://brownspace.org/), or BSE for short. What follows is the story of EQUiSat, our little satellite that could (link http://brownspace.org/equisat).</p>
  
  <b>The Mission</b>
  <p>When I went to the BSE general team meeting the following Sunday, the team wasn’t even officially a team yet; until very recently they had just been a group of undergraduate students excited about space. They would get together once or twice a week to talk about what it would take for someone to one day theoretically build a satellite based on a class project ofone day  theirs. This class project was developed a few years prior by a group of engineering seniors, who came up with a (relatively) simple but solid idea for a satellite: an artificial shooting star that shines so brightly that it can be seen from the ground, so it can inspire interstellar interest and test a power system that could deliver a ton of power at once (LEDs you can see from space have to be very bright). They filed an application with NASA to get a ride to space, and the project appealed to NASA’s education mission so much that we were granted one!</p>
  
  <b>Applying For Launch</b>
  <p>When I joined, the group had just received (link https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/february/nasa-announces-fifth-round-of-cubesat-space-mission-candidates) word that they were one of the few student applications chosen by NASA for a free launch as part of the ELaNa (Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (link https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-elana)) missions. ELaNa is a NASA program that encourages students to develop space engineering skills by giving them access to real space launches, so their work can actually see the stars. However, because they are launching on real rockets contracted by NASA, this means that the student works are held to the same high standards that NASA has for their other space launches. What was once a fun senior project was now slated to be strapped to a rocket aimed hundreds of kilometers above our heads, where the satellite would then need to endure the brutality of space while completing its mission.</p>
  <p>As of 2019 (link https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-cubesat-launch-initiative), 85 cubesats have been flown on 22 different ELaNa missions, with 36 more cubesats scheduled for flight. These include many college projects, but also a high school and an elementary school satellite! Often times these cubesats hitch a ride to space by sharing a rocket launch alongside a government mission, but NASA has recently been looking into utilizing new cubesat launch companies to also fulfill the missions. The satellites often conduct science in space or demonstrate a new technology, and ours involves some of the latter but also appeals to NASA’s educational side by inspiring people around the world to look up at the stars and get interested in space (on a budget)!</p>
  <p>While the ground-visible LEDs fulfilled NASA’s education and outreach missions, our design also included a type of battery that NASA had never tested in space before: Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries. These batteries are able to power high current circuits and while research said they would almost certainly work in space, people wanted us to try them first before they put them into any of their multi-million dollar missions. Thus our primary mission was to increase accessibility to space using a low budget satellite (under $5000) and our secondary objective was to test the LiFePO4 batteries for NASA.</p>
  
  <b>CubeSats</b>
  <p>Before talking about any more details of the satellite, I should probably introduce the concept of a CubeSat. According to NASA (https://www.nasa.gov/content/what-are-smallsats-and-CubeSats), “CubeSats are a class of nanosatellites that use a standard size and form factor.” The CubeSat standard was created in 1999 and has become increasingly popular for many areas of space. People seem to think they are quite small compared to how large they think a satellite normally is, with a single CubeSat measuring 10x10x10 cm (~4 inch cube). This tissue box sized cube is also called a 1U CubeSat, or a one unit CubeSat. However, satellite engineers often need larger sizes in order to accommodate various sensors and instruments, so the CubeSat standard allows engineers to build them in various multiples of units like in the image below (image from NASA (link https://www.nasa.gov/content/what-are-smallsats-and-CubeSats).)</p>
