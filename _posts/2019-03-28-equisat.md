<hr>
<p>One day in the fall of 2013 during my sophomore year in college, I was walking around the engineering building, and happened to look up at the TVs that played student and department announcements. I saw a call for students to join a growing engineering team and thought I’d go check it out. I was, unknowingly at the time, making one of the best decisions of my life. This is how I joined the Brown Space Engineering <a target="_blank" href="https://brownspace.org/">team</a>, or BSE for short. What follows is the story of EQUiSat, our little satellite that <a target="_blank" href="http://brownspace.org/equisat">could</a>.</p>

<b class="section-title">The Mission</b>
<p>When I went to the BSE general team meeting the following Sunday, the team wasn’t even officially a team yet; until very recently they had just been a group of undergraduate students excited about space. They would get together once or twice a week to talk about what it would take for someone to one day theoretically build a satellite based on a class project ofone day  theirs. This class project was developed a few years prior by a group of engineering seniors, who came up with a (relatively) simple but solid idea for a satellite: an artificial shooting star that shines so brightly that it can be seen from the ground, so it can inspire interstellar interest and test a power system that could deliver a ton of power at once (LEDs you can see from space have to be very bright). They filed an application with NASA to get a ride to space, and the project appealed to NASA’s education mission so much that we were granted one!</p>

<b class="section-title">Applying For Launch</b>
<p>When I joined, the group had just <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/press/2014/february/nasa-announces-fifth-round-of-cubesat-space-mission-candidates">received</a> word that they were one of the few student applications chosen by NASA for a free launch as part of the ELaNa (Educational Launch of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-elana">Nanosatellites</a>) missions. ELaNa is a NASA program that encourages students to develop space engineering skills by giving them access to real space launches, so their work can actually see the stars. However, because they are launching on real rockets contracted by NASA, this means that the student works are held to the same high standards that NASA has for their other space launches. What was once a fun senior project was now slated to be strapped to a rocket aimed hundreds of kilometers above our heads, where the satellite would then need to endure the brutality of space while completing its mission.</p>
<p>As of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/about-cubesat-launch-initiative">2019</a>, 85 cubesats have been flown on 22 different ELaNa missions, with 36 more cubesats scheduled for flight. These include many college projects, but also a high school and an elementary school satellite! Often times these cubesats hitch a ride to space by sharing a rocket launch alongside a government mission, but NASA has recently been looking into utilizing new cubesat launch companies to also fulfill the missions. The satellites often conduct science in space or demonstrate a new technology, and ours involves some of the latter but also appeals to NASA’s educational side by inspiring people around the world to look up at the stars and get interested in space (on a budget)!</p>
<p>While the ground-visible LEDs fulfilled NASA’s education and outreach missions, our design also included a type of battery that NASA had never tested in space before: Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries. These batteries are able to power high current circuits and while research said they would almost certainly work in space, people wanted us to try them first before they put them into any of their multi-million dollar missions. Thus our primary mission was to increase accessibility to space using a low budget satellite (under $5000) and our secondary objective was to test the LiFePO4 batteries for NASA.</p>

<b class="section-title">CubeSats</b>
<p>Before talking about any more details of the satellite, I should probably introduce the concept of a CubeSat. According to NASA (https://www.nasa.gov/content/what-are-smallsats-and-CubeSats), “CubeSats are a class of nanosatellites that use a standard size and form factor.” The CubeSat standard was created in 1999 and has become increasingly popular for many areas of space. People seem to think they are quite small compared to how large they think a satellite normally is, with a single CubeSat measuring 10x10x10 cm (~4 inch cube). This tissue box sized cube is also called a 1U CubeSat, or a one unit CubeSat. However, satellite engineers often need larger sizes in order to accommodate various sensors and instruments, so the CubeSat standard allows engineers to build them in various multiples of units like in the image below)</p>
<img class="centered-image" src="/assets/equisat/images/nasa_cubesat_sizes.png">
<p class="image-caption">Image Credit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/what-are-smallsats-and-CubeSats">NASA</a>.</p>
<p>Our satellite fits the 1U CubeSat standard. Five sides are solar panels and one side has a panel of LEDs that flash bright enough to be seen with the naked eye from the ground. The inside of the cube is made up of mostly electronics that handle charging the batteries, flashing the LEDs, collecting data, and talking to Earth. As seen below in the screenshot of our website’s data <a target="_blank" href="http://equisat.brownspace.org/data">dashboard</a> we record data including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>temperature of the satellite and LEDs</li>
  <li>battery charge</li>
  <li>amount of sunlight on each side of the satellite</li>
  <li>magnetic field data</li>
  <li>acceleration and orientation values</li>
</ul>

<p class="image-caption">A screenshot from our data dashboard <a target="_blank" href="http://equisat.brownspace.org/data">site</a>.</p>
<p>Some great summaries of recent contributions and advances with CubeSats can be found in this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/science/cubesats-marco-mars.html">NYTimes article</a> and this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2018/12/26/676731720/whats-next-for-tiny-satellites">NPR article</a> which describe the use of CubeSats to relay data during the descent of the landing of the NASA Mars InSight probe.</p>
<p>All in all, our 10cm cube cost us $3,776.61 according to our bill of materials, not including labor of course. This is also not factoring in the cost of the launch that would likely have <a target="_blank" href="http://nanoracks.com/resources/faq/">been</a> around $85,000; thank you NASA! Nonetheless, it is quite a low cost for the satellite; a typical CubeSat of similar complexity usually starts at $30,000 when buying the parts from a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pumpkinspace.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html">vendor</a>. We were able to save a great deal of money through three main strategies: using off the shelf components, manufacturing the satellite ourselves, and by using a passive attitude control system. By using regular electronics components off the shelf that were not guaranteed to be rated for use in outer space we could get them cheaper, and then check ourselves to make sure there would not be any problems. An example of this is using many small scrap pieces of solar panels which together work as well as a single one. You can see in the picture below how there is an arrangement of many small solar panel pieces instead of one large cell per side like satellites typically have; each piece is the corner of a square they cut circular solar panels out of, so we were able to get them at a much cheaper price.</p>

<b class="section-title">Building the Satellite</b>
<p>Once we had the launch contract with NASA, all we had to do was put the satellite together. Easy, right? While relatively simple compared to some of the space stunts NASA can pull off, it took us about 4 years of engineering and manufacturing to get to the final satellite. Even though we had been theorizing about the mission and had some preliminary design plans in place before this, we still went through several major revisions of everything, from the solar panels to the main computer components. All of this work was done in various labs, shops, and classrooms in the Brown Engineering building throughout our undergraduate careers there. During this process we all learned a great deal about space engineering, including just how many things we take for granted sitting down here on Earth with a big cushy atmosphere above our heads.</p>

<p>The first of these Earth-bound assumptions is that the air keeps the temperature we experience fairly constant and constrained. However, while in orbit our small satellite experiences temperatures ranging from -30°C to 50°C (-22°F to 122°F), depending on how much sunlight is shining on it. We did several experiments to test our temperature sensors, including leaving it out in the (cold, but not as cold as space admittedly) Providence winter weather for long durations and putting it in my dorm room fridge (as seen below).</p>

<p>The LEDs on the satellite also heat up considerably when flashing. While this heat can dissipate into the atmosphere on Earth, we aren’t afforded this luxury in the vacuum of space. This meant we had to be careful to make sure the heat from the LEDs didn’t travel through the metal pieces of the satellite to places where it could melt our electronics. To address this issue, we had to use a special coating on the backs of the LEDs so that the heat would flow into the satellite chassis, not the circuits powering the lights. Moreover, we ran into another heat issue while testing flashing the LEDs for the first time; the test stand we had 3D printed to keep them upright quickly melted after we turned on the LEDs, forcing us to design a sturdier flash test apparatus.</p>

<p>The second challenge that we were required to address during this process is radiation. While satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) like ours don’t experience as much radiation as communication satellites in Geosynchronous Orbit (GEO), it can still interfere with the electronics onboard (for reference, LEO is ~400km and GEO is ~35,000km up.) Radiation interference can happen when high energy particles pass through the satellite and hit its computer chips, which can corrupt the code stored onboard. To protect against this, we included a small piece of radiation-resilient memory (MRAM), which stores a copy of all the satellite code and important constants like the number of seconds since boot. Now, if we detect any errors, we can reboot and reload the uncorrupted copy of the code from the MRAM.</p>
<p>Next, we had to address what I believe is one of the more interesting issues of space engineering: selecting parts that will withstand the effects of the vacuum of space. In space, we can’t rely on having a constant ~1atm of pressure to keep everything together, something that we typically take for granted sitting under so many kilometers of atmosphere. Putting parts into a vacuum that are not designed for those conditions can lead to what is called outgassing, where any air inside the part causes it to explode because there is no longer any air outside to keep it in. Because of this, we had to specially select LEDs that would work in space, being careful that there were not any small pockets of air inside them that could be leftover from when it was molded. If there were any leftover air, our LED panel could have turned into a shrapnel bomb. We also had to make sure the coatings we put on our solar panels didn’t have bubbles in them for the same reason. We were able to test some of this in a small vacuum chamber we had in the Brown engineering building, seen below. An additional precaution we took in order to prevent EQUiSat from generating space debris was using Locite, a thread locking paste, on the screws to make sure they couldn’t vibrate loose on the bumpy ride up.</p>

<p>Finally, another amusing problem we faced is one that I had always overlooked when thinking about how things got up to space. When launching a satellite to orbit, I typically thought of how it sat atop a rocket, the rocket taking off, letting go of the satellite at the right time, and then the rocket falling back to Earth (or landing!) But once it’s been thrown out into space, how does the satellite actually know what direction to point in? CubeSats especially are usually somewhat crudely pushed out of the side of a rocket (or space station), and are thus tumbling rapidly upon ejection. It turns out that orienting the satellite can be a pretty hard problem, one that more expensive satellites accomplish with systems of reaction wheels or small jets of gas. We ended up using a much simpler solution involving magnets to align ourselves with the magnetic field of the Earth. Using some magical physics, when the CubeSat is spinning the magnets move through the magnetic field of the Earth and slow down the spin of the satellite, guiding it to an angle parallel to the magnetic field lines of the Earth. Thus, the satellite will be pointing towards the planet while over the northern hemisphere! See the great explanation on our <a target="_blank" href="http://brownspace.org/ACDS/">website</a> for more info.</p>
<p>In the end we were able to make a fully fledged CubeSat in time to hand off to NASA, so they could load it into a resupply capsule headed for the International Space Station. It looked almost exactly like the CAD model below, and you can check out the interactive CAD model on our <a target="_blank" href="http://equisat.brownspace.org/cad">website</a> or mobile app.</p>

<p class="image-caption">A CAD model of EQUiSat.</p>
<p>While this technical work had been going on we had also been fulfilling the other huge part of our mission, the educational outreach objectives. For years we have had groups of team members go to elementary schools around Providence and give lessons on engineering, physics, and space to the students. We’re hoping that this teaching in combination with our successes in orbit can help inspire the next generation of space engineers!</p>

<b class="section-title">The Launch</b>
<p>Before we put our satellite on board any rocket to space we had to first make sure that it would survive the journey into orbit. Riding to space on a rocket is basically sitting in a box on top of a somewhat controlled explosion ripping through a turbulent atmosphere, so things tend to get bumpy onboard. We had done some basic tests ourselves, but with much less rigorous equipment than what professionals use to space certify satellites. We were fortunate enough to have some amazing volunteers at UTC Aerospace give their time and equipment so we could do vibration testing; this testing alone usually costs a CubeSat $7,000 (space is expensive)! EQUiSat passed the first time around, so it was time to put it on the rocket and send it to the stars; the question was, which rocket?</p>

<p>Previously I mentioned that NASA had given us a spot on a launch to space, but we didn’t yet know which launch we would be on or to which orbit we would get. In 2015, NASA began asking us if we wanted to go up on specific launches that would put us in an orbit close to the ones we requested; the catch was that we could only say “no” so many times before being put to the back of the education launch queue, so we had to carefully consider each launch. We wanted to make sure that we would have enough time to finish the satellite before the launch, so we had to start focusing more on our making our progress projections accurate. We also had to check that we would be in an orbit low enough where the satellite would be visible, but high enough that it would stay up for a while before the orbit decayed and it burned up. Satellites in orbit can start to lose altitude because the Earth’s atmosphere slows them down bit by bit over time. Contrary to popular belief, the gases of the Earth’s atmosphere don’t have a hard border where they stop and space starts; even several hundred kilometers up there are very faint but noticeable wafts of the atmosphere!</p>
<p>Originally, we had agreed to fly aboard the inaugural flight of a space startup’s orbital rocket. I was personally nervous about being onboard any first orbital launch, because if there’s one thing I’ve learned with my exposure to space engineering, it’s that <b>space is hard</b>. I didn’t have to worry for long though, because soon after we accepted, the company ran into legal issues which prevented them from launching, but NASA quickly told us not to worry and that we would still be given a ride to space. We then accepted a spot in a resupply mission to the International Space Station launched by Orbital ATK (now Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems); we would be a part of the OA-9 mission, on an Antares rocket with a Cygnus capsule launching out of Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. EQUiSat was integrated by NanoRacks, which means they were the ones that actually put our satellite in the ISS resupply pod alongside all the other science experiments and supplies.</p>
<p>We were so excited; real astronauts were going to touch our satellite (well, the NanoRacks satellite pod our satellite was in)! On the ISS! CubeSats are regularly deployed from the ISS, in a manner that I like to say is akin to the astronauts throwing them out the window but is actually only slightly more sophisticated than that. The astronauts have a slot in their busy science schedules allocated to taking the satellites out of the resupply capsule, loading them into a Nanoracks CubeSat <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NanoRacks_CubeSat_Deployer">Deployer</a> (which is a tube with all the satellites in a line), and pushing the button that spring shoots them into space. Remember that because the satellites conform to the CubeSat standard, they can all fit in the same sized tube next to each other, making this path to space possible. The CubeSats also all have separation springs between them in this tube, so that when they are released into space they don’t bump into each other (you can see them pusing apart in the gif of the deployment below). There was one thing we had to be careful of now that humans were helping launch our satellite though; because it is supposed to shine bright enough to be visible in space, we had to be extra cautious not to flash while any astronauts were handling it. As blinding the ISS crew would likely create an international crisis, we were designated as a “Catastrophic Ocular Hazard” by NASA. It was tricky to deal with this, because there were not any physical switches that could handle the current flowing to the LEDs that were also small enough to fit into the satellite, so we had to resort to a combination of hardware and software.  To deal with this we wrote our software so that it could not flash until the batteries reached a certain voltage; this could not happen until the satellite had been in space for a while, thus far enough away from the ISS such that the astronauts would be safe from our flashing.</p>
<p>In March 2018, we handed off our satellite to NASA by flying it down to NanoRack’s office in Houston, making sure to let the TSA know ahead of time what we were bringing by showing them a letter from our launch provider, Nanoracks, and some of our schematics and CAD drawings. The ELaNa 23 mission we were a part of was among other science and ISS resupply objectives for the launch; the other satellites next to our CubeSat were <a target="_blank" href="http://u.osu.edu/cuberrt/">CubeRRT</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://halosat.physics.uiowa.edu/">HaloSat</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://mstl.atl.calpoly.edu/~workshop/archive/2017/Spring/Alternates/Sangho%20Shin.pdf">MemSat</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/radsat-g.htm">RadSat-g</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cubesat/missions/raincube.php">RainCube</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/cubesat/missions/tempest-d.php">TEMPEST-D</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.endurosat.com/">EnduroSat</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/radix.htm">Radix</a>. A funny coincidence we realized is that one of the people who built another satellite in our launch actually had our adviser as a professor in the past; small world! At that point the fate of our little cube was out of our hands, or so we thought.</p>

<p>A few weeks after we gave it away, one of our engineers realized that we were leaving out a code feature when running the satellite program through our system tests. When we reran our tests with the correct version of the code, we realized there was a glitch that rebooted the satellite after flashing. While this would not kill the mission, it could potentially introduce issues if the system rebooted before transmitting all its data. Fortunately, Nanoracks was generous enough to let two of our software engineers fly down to Houston to load a last minute software patch into the satellite and run it through all its tests again. This was very generous of them, because all the other satellites had already been spring loaded into the launcher rack next to ours and people are rightfully nervous of the most minor adjustments when it comes to space. In the end we were approved because we only had to plug in a programming cable, so none of the other satellites would be disturbed. Nothing like this had happened before with their deployments, so their approval set a precedent for future software-only updates. After this small crisis was averted, the satellite was <b>actually</b> out of our hands. Our satellite and the rest of the CubeSats in the NanoRacks deployer were put inside the ISS resupply capsule, and then placed in the Cygnus capsule on top of the Orbital ATK Antares rocket.</p>

<p>The team and many years worth of alumni drove down to the site in Virginia to see the launch. It was amazing to have the founding members of the project, the current freshmen on the team, and everyone in between in the same place for the first time, seeing what we had been working on for so many years finally go to space. The launch was scheduled for 4:39am, so many of us only tried to sleep for a few hours that night, some of us unable to due to excitement and others from nervousness. We had a reason to be nervous though, because a key detail of the launch was that there was only a 5 minute window starting at 4:39 during which the rocket could takeoff and make it to the ISS. If it got delayed more than that then it would get pushed back at least another day, and few, if any, of us would have been able to stay until then. Launches can get delayed due to bad weather, anomalous sensor readings, or issues with the launch site as trivial as someone in a boat getting too close. All of this can happen up until T-0 seconds to liftoff, so we were on the edge of our seats the entire time.</p>

<p>We had a very good viewing position because the neighborhood we stayed in happened to be on the coast across from the launch site with a clear line of site between a nearby cul de sac and the rocket several miles away. At around 4:00am we all headed down the street to get in position and set up some cameras, alongside several other groups of space enthusiasts also there to watch the launch. I was constantly refreshing the Twitter feed of Orbital ATK checking for updates, dreading a tweet saying they were scrubbing it. The weather was questionable and we were all unsure if it would hold up long enough to get the rocket to space. Orbital was saying all systems green on their Twitter feed, but then around 4:14am they said they were pushing the launch to the latest allowed by the launch window, 4:44am, to hold out for the best weather conditions possible.</p>

<p>4:39am came and went, and we were frantically checking any and all sources of information about the launch. On pins and needles we celebrated the arrival of 4:43am, T-60 seconds to liftoff, without any cancellation notifications. Then T-30. Then T-10, 9, 8, … <b>T-0</b>.</p>

<p>I mean that in the literal sense of the word; it was one of the most awe-inspiring things I’d ever seen. The entire night sky lit up with the flames from the engines, and the building-sized rocket started to lift into the sky. It briefly went behind some low hanging clouds, temporarily putting a diffusing lampshade on the upside down candle hurtling through the sky. We actually couldn’t hear it until several seconds after launch, and then the crackling roar was the auditory embodiment of raw power.</p>
<p>And then, almost as quickly as it started turning the night sky into day, the rocket was out of sight. We could still hear it for a while as the light from it faded to look like a star and then disappear altogether. A common misconception people have about space is that the rocket’s only job is to just lift the payload up high; the rocket’s primary job is really to accelerate it extremely quickly sideways so it can reach orbital speed (~7.8km/s or ~17,448mph)! This meant that our satellite was quickly disappearing into the sky out over the Atlantic, leaving us behind on Earth. After our cheering subsided, we took a moment as a team to reflect on everything we’d just accomplished (with our adviser Rick Fleeter on speakerphone from Rome where he was helping get our other ground station set up); something our team had designed and built was now accelerating to speeds we can’t even imagine en route to the ISS. Something made during our (lack of) free time entirely by undergraduates turned first time space engineers, driven by our desire to make it to space.</p>

<b class="section-title">Life in ~~~ S P A C E ~~~</b>
<p>The rocket with EQUiSat onboard lifted off on May 21, 2018, and after about three days, the resupply capsule made it to the ISS. While they could shoot the capsule straight to the space station, any small errors in sensor measurements or offsets in trajectory on the intense ride up could lead to a catastrophe if the capsule comes in too fast or off course, so they launch it into an orbit where it can slowly and carefully maneuver itself to match up with the ISS.</p>

<p>Our satellite is in that supply capsule in the picture above! Once it docks, the astronauts have to check that all its contents are still in shape; thankfully ours was. We were told that it would be sometime in late June or early July that the astronauts would be scheduled to release it into space. Finally, on July 13, 2018, it was shot out of the ISS using the NanoRacks deployer via the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNxZhrIrV78">JEM airlock</a>, positioned via the JEMRMS robotic arm, along with the rest of the other CubeSats that went up in the tube alongside EQUiSat.</p>

<p>In order to listen for any word from EQUiSat, our team setup two ground radio stations, one in Providence at our university’s Ladd Observatory, and the other at Sapienza University of Rome, where our advisor spends half his year teaching. In addition to this, we released instructions on our website for HAM radio operators to listen in and see any data we transmit, which you can find <a target="_blank" href="https://brownspace.org/receiving-equisat/">here</a>. We also have an awesome <a target="_blank" href="https://decoder.brownspace.org/">decoder site</a> where you can upload your own recorded transmissions for us to decode!</p>
<img id="rome-station" class="centered-image" src="/assets/equisat/images/rome_ground_station.jpg">
<p>After being released into the void, EQUiSat tumbled around in orbit for 7 hours until we made initial radio contact with it via our ground station in Rome. We were ecstatic! Our project was broadcasting to the world, and it’s system status was “HELLO_WORLD” like we expected (in this case it is both a joke on the programming trope of “hello world” being the first thing you code, and literally saying hello to the world.) As the data came in we started figuring out exactly what our little satellite was doing; it went through the startup sequence as we planned, and eventually went into IDLE_NO_FLASH mode which meant it was waiting for the batteries to have enough charge to flash. And then after 12 days on July 25th, we got this data back:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">EQUiSat has started flashing its LEDs and we&#39;ve received the first flash data!

<p>What you’re seeing with the yellow and blue curves are a huge increase in the power being drawn (with 4 batteries at 6.5 amps each that’s 26 amps total!) by the LEDs, meaning the satellite flashed for the first time! This was confirmation that the primary technical achievement of our satellite was working; hopefully soon we will be able to get a video of it blinking in the night sky. If you want to get a notification about when EQUiSat will fly over you or check out its current position and radio transmissions, download our Android app <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.brownspace.equisat">here</a> or here for <a target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/equisat/id1413644444">iOS</a>; it’s very well done and I’m super proud of the team for putting it together so nicely.</p>

<p>As of this writing, our little satellite that could is flying across Botswana going about 7.654km/s (17,000 mph) at an altitude of 406.11km above the Earth. It won’t be in Africa for long though because it’s moving so fast. There was one night I wanted to go outside my Boston apartment and look up when it was in the area (I was doing it more for symbolic reasons, as the city light pollution would likely drown out the flash, but it should be visible from the suburbs). I checked the app and EQUiSat was currently over New Zealand, but just half an hour later it was passing by me in New England. Following its position on the app as it zipped across all the states in the Northeast made me really appreciate just how fast things are moving in space. Few of us have ever experienced anything moving even a fraction that speed!</p>
<p>So currently (as of January 2019 at least) EQUiSat has launched and deployed successfully, been alive in orbit for six months (!), sent us data via radio, and is flashing; we just don’t have any visual recordings of flashes yet. For the last few months of 2018, it was not flashing as often as usual because its orbit drifted such that it spent more time in the night side of the planet and so was trying to conserve power. While frustrating for trying to get videos of it flashing, it is a good demonstration of our software logic! Plus it should be in orbit for 12-18 months so we still have time to see it. I’ll update this post when we either get footage of it flashing or have any new developments, in the meantime check out <a target="_blank" href="http://brownspace.org/viewing-equisat/">this guide</a> to try to see it for yourself!</p>

<p>I’m going to assume you’ve at least skimmed the other version for a background on the satellite and mission; if not, I recommend doing that first. While I’ll mainly be focusing on the details of the computer systems work we did, I recommend everyone take a look!</p>
<hr>
<b class="section-title">The System</b>
<p>For a brief technical overview of our satellite’s components and systems you can watch this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6DWplTRL_I">video</a>. The satellite’s electronics include the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An Atmel SAMD21J18A processor, with a ARM Cortex-M0+ CPU clocked up to 48MHz</li>
  <li>2 500KB chips of MRAM, which serves as a radiation resilient area where we store our program code to be loaded on boot (we duplicated data across both chips for redundancy)</li>
  <li>6 IR sensors and 6 photodiodes, one on each face of the CubeSat</li>
  <li>An inertial measurement unit (IMU), consisting of a gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer</li>
  <li>A temperature sensor for the radio, IMU, each of the 4 LEDs, and 4 of our 6 batteries</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information see our <a target="_blank" href="https://brownspace.org/avionics-software/">software page</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://brownspace.org/equisat-resources/#1523833022828-35a40fbd-d882">technical docs</a>. We talk to these components via I2C, SPI, USART, GPIO, and PWM to gather their values so we can make decisions about when to flash, deploy antennas, and perform other operations before sending them to the radio to be beamed down to Earth. While I think programming hardware is very satisfying once you get it actually working, this experience was a reminder of all the pains hardware can add to regular software debugging. Between messing up our test circuit designs, dead on arrival circuit boards, or blowing up the components, there was no shortage of issues to go through with the avionics. All of this was complicated by the fact that we started off being scrappy and working in the open electronics lab at Brown, so we had to set up and put away all our components every time; eventually we got our own space which was a huge help, dramatically increasing our efficiency and allowing us to perform long-running tests. I highly recommend it to any other teams!</p>
<p>To see the satellite CAD files you can check out this <a target="_blank" href="https://brownspace.org/equisat-resources/#1459114659935-8a2aed24-43a0">link</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BrownSpaceEngineering/EquiSat-EAGLE.git">here</a> are all the EAGLE files for the various PCBs in the system.</p>

<b class="section-title">The Code</b>
<p>Our code was written in C and can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BrownSpaceEngineering/EQUiSatOS">here</a>. We use FreeRTOS as the base OS for the satellite, which gives us a useful task scheduler and event loop. The satellite is a state machine with six states (INITIAL, ANTENNA DEPLOY, HELLO WORLD, IDLE FLASH, IDLE NO FLASH, LOW POWER), which we transition between for various events during the mission. We also almost had a GOODBYE/RIP state that would be entered when the satellite was about to die, but removed it because we didn’t think there was much purpose and wanted as simple a system as possible to minimize risk. For more details on these transitions, see the picture below. In general, we have a flow through the first three states from the initial boot to first radio transmit, and a flow between the last three states for when the satellite is fully booted and communicating in its ‘steady state’. The latter three states handle when we flash, with the transition logic centered on having normally charging batteries with sufficient voltage to power the LEDs.</p>
<img id="state-diagram" class="centered-image" src="/assets/equisat/images/state_diagram.png">
<p class="image-caption">Transition diagram for the satellite state machine.</p>
<p>One feature of space that we don’t have to deal with on the ground is ionizing radiation flipping bits and changing the values stored in memory. In order to try to combat this, we store critical values (the addresses of persistent memory locations, fields in the bootloader such as the MRAM processor pins, and the address of the satellite boot code) in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BrownSpaceEngineering/EQUiSatOS/blob/b2bffd29c0a3e64c9bf969b63844caf8ba5108bf/EQUiSatOS/EQUiSatOS/src/processor_drivers/MRAM_Commands.h#L80">triplicate</a> and if any one of the three copies is different then we take the value the other two have (all three being different is unlikely enough that we just give up in that mode). We additionally have a system watchdog, which is a timer that checks every few hundred milliseconds if we’ve called a function to “pet” the watchdog. If our program fails to call this function, then we do a hard system reset. Because we wrote the code to call it more frequently than the timeout, any misses imply that we haven’t arrived at that line in the code recently and something is wrong. In the event of a system reset, we check if there is any difference between the currently running code and the copy of the program stored in radiation safe MRAM and reload the code if there is. Along with the rest of the satellite errors, these reset events are also stored in MRAM so they can be transmitted at the next downlink, so we know when the satellite had to recover from a single event upset (SEU). This method is not foolproof, because the bootloader can still be corrupted and possibly result in an unbootable satellite, but it minimizes the risk and should be sufficient given that we are only in LEO; it may not be if we sent EQUiSat somewhere more radiation heavy like Jupiter, maybe next time.</p>
<p>Between radio transmissions, we keep some data around to build up a buffer of values before transmitting, storing them in a custom data structure, affectionately named the EQUiStack, that is essentially a hybrid of a priority queue and a stack. This is to ensure that errors and more recent data get downlinked, but the oldest data is replaced first when we have new data to store. In order to be safe, we statically allocate all our data structures for storing the transmission data on boot, so we could rule out many types of memory issues. We tuned out storage data structured so we used about 99% of our available memory, and all our software for running the satellite ended up fitting in ~110KB.</p>
<p>We also compiled the code with flags that minimize its size, in the hopes this could make a slightly smaller target for radiation to hit while in the rad-safe memory. This code size optimization was actually part of our last minute bug fix I mentioned before, where two of our teammates had to fly down to Nanoracks in Houston and do a software patch while the satellite was in the P-Pod. Towards the end of our software development, we introduced a buffer out of bounds read which would cause the code to segfault when executed in a binary built with a code size optimization flag. Specifically, running a binary built with -OS would cause a read out of bounds bug to enter an infinite loop and eventually segfault, whereas -O0 or -O1 would just return some bad data. This segfault meant our program failed to pet the watchdog, and so the system would reboot. Our main issue was that our duplicated hardware testing environment compiled the code with a different set of flags than the ones we used to build the binary for the final satellite, namely we did not use the code size optimization flag in testing, and the code managed to avoid segfaulting without it. Two key lessons to take away from this which I’ve seen many times before and are now even more firmly cemented as necessary software principles: make sure your test and production settings are the same, and always test your code and binaries before you push it to production (or push them to space)!</p>
<p>When designing the software we were always concerned with knowing exactly if and when the satellite fails, so we developed a long list of possible errors (which you can find <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/BrownSpaceEngineering/EQUiSatOS/blob/master/EQUiSatOS/EQUiSatOS/src/errors.h">here</a> if interested!) This will allow us to know the timestamp, code, and satellite component that failed if/when we experienced any of these!</p>

<b class="section-title">The Radio</b>
<p>In order to talk to our satellite, we use an XDL Micro Transceiver from Pacific Crest Communications, transmitting at 435.55 MHz. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this transceiver has been used in space (the manufacturer even told us it may not work but we tested it and did it successfully anyway). We transmit every 20 seconds with a burst of four 213ms transmissions, each 750ms apart, unless we are in low power mode, during which we only make two transmissions every 40 seconds. Our callsign is WL9XZE, and more details can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://brownspace.org/receiving-equisat/.">here</a> Once we got our development boards setup we bought a USB software-defined radio (SDR) to test that we were able to properly send data from the satellite. However, we had a lot of difficulty demodulating/decoding our own transmissions. After some digging, we found that the radio we settled on actually uses a non-standard modulation to make it so its transmissions can only be decoded by their radios! Another lesson from engineering once again ingrained in my mind: test early and fail fast! Once we got the right radios setup we were good to go. Unfortunately this meant that only the two ground stations that we setup ourselves in Providence and Rome would be able to decode the packets from the satellite. Our way to let others join the mission was to setup a webpage where you can upload the data you receive and have our software decode it and add it to our public data logs; that page can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://decoder.brownspace.org/">here</a>, along with instructions on how to listen to the satellite on your own.

<p>The antenna for the radio was too long to fit into the CubeSat rack, so we had to solve the challenge of deploying it once in space. While we could have used a telescoping antenna, we didn’t want to risk a mechanical failure; the radio is the only way we can find anything out about what’s going on with the mission, so making sure the antenna deployed correctly was a critical task. We ended up settling on a design where the antenna was coiled to fit on one side of the satellite, held in place by a small piece of nylon string wrapped around nichrome wire that heated up when electricity passed through it. We used Nitinol wire for the antenna material because it is known for retaining its shape, so when it springs open it will be in a straight line dipole antenna; having an antenna without bends is key to maximizing the equivalent power of the radio! Then when it was time to deploy the antenna all we had to do was turn on the power so the string would melt and the antenna would spring open! We used PWM to control the power for melting the string, so that we could easily adjust the duty cycle to heat the specific piece of wire just enough so only the string and not the antenna melted. The antenna deployed successfully, which prevented what I think would have been the most disappointing failure mode for the mission, where we never hear anything back from EQUiSat. We assume the antenna deployed at least, because in reality we will never actually know and it is possible that our antenna deploy sensor failed and that the antenna is loud enough that we can still transmit even while it is coiled up.</p>

<p>Everything so far has been talking about how we receive data from the satellite; what about sending data the other way? We have the capability to send commands to EQUiSat in order to echo back a message, reboot, flash on demand, stop flashing, and restart flashing. We also have some commands mandated by the FCC which are to make the radio stop transmitting in case we are interfering with others’ communications. We first tested our uplink abilities by sending an echo command on December 1st, 2018, which you can see in the radio spectrogram picture below!</p>

<p>We’ve also been able to successfully remote reboot the satellite, and command it to start/stop being in FLASH mode. We have been doing this in order to force it into FLASH mode during times where we may be able to get images from the ground of it flashing.</p>

<b class="section-title">Testing</b>
<p>You rarely get second chances in space, so we had to make sure that we got everything right the first time. In order to test if our code would hold up over a long period of time, we built what we called FlatSat, a hardware copy of the satellite; instead of being put into a chassis, it was spread across a table in our workshop. Having this allowed us to iterate on our software and run long OS tests while the hardware teams assembled the final satellite, and the many logs (gigabytes of text) we gathered from this process allowed us to verify that our code was properly moving the satellite between its many states. We simulated different sensor and voltage inputs to test that the system responded properly, hoping that all our scenarios would add up to something representative enough of the harsh void of space. These included putting FlatSat in a vacuum chamber and leaving it out in the (cold, but not as cold as space admittedly) Providence winter weather for long durations.</p>
<p>Testing the LEDs also had its issues. For one, the LEDs draw so much power that at first we struggled to find a power source that could handle them! (Eventually we just ended up testing using our spare batteries instead of a wall outlet.) Once we got situated we had to be careful because the LEDs are so bright that no one could be in the room without eclipse viewing goggles when the LEDs were shining at their max 44,000 lumens.</p>

<p>To test the radio, we first made sure that all our radio commands could be sent and received between the radio on the satellite and the radio that was to go into the ground station. We also used a spectrum analyzer to make sure that we were transmitting on the correct frequency, and tested the antenna gain to see that we should be able to hear it from space.</p>

<p>We also tested the solar panels, by shining bright lights on them and simply making sure they charged our batteries. However, it was difficult to find bright enough lights, and the panels were built for being lit by the Sun with no atmosphere, which is quite different from a light bulb in a room!</p>

<p>Once we had the final satellite assembled and tested, we inserted the Remove Before Flight (RBF) pin, which shut off the whole CubeSat. The other way to shut the system off is to hold down a set of switches on the satellite; these are held down while in the launcher rack so that it can’t turn on until after it is in the void. There are four switches in total that disconnect the system in two different ways so as to be more fault tolerant; two switches disconnect the computer from its Li-ion batteries and the other two disconnect each of the Li-ion batteries from ground. On March 7th, when EQUiSat was finally placed in the NanoRacks launcher, all four were pressed down so it was safe to remove the Remove Before Flight pin. Several months later when EQUiSat was jettisoned from the ISS, the switches were released and the satellite sensed it was in space! After this, it started a timer for 30 minutes and then deployed the antenna to begin transmitting. The 30 minute delay is a NASA rule to ensure that the cubesats are far away enough from the station and each other before they start operating, to avoid possible interference. This delay was possible because while the Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries that power the LEDs were not initially charged, the Li-ion batteries that power the onboard computer were.</p>

<p>Our orbit is very similar to that of the ISS, but we don’t boost ourselves back up like they do so our altitude will always be slowly decaying and we will burn up in the Earth’s atmosphere in 12-18 months. We are at an altitude of almost 400km (248 miles) moving at a velocity of around 7.6km/s (15658 mph), at an inclination (the angle from the equator) of around 51°, and in an almost perfectly circular orbit (our min/max altitudes are not that different.) Another fun fact about our orbit is that a Russian satellite SiriusSat-1 actually passed within 2.9km (1.8 miles) of us in November 2018, which is extremely close in space terms! The awesome Mike Umbricht at Brown discovered this close approach because the two satellites also transmit on similar frequencies and modulations, and we were mistaking their communications for ours.</p>

<p>In the last few months of 2018 the satellite temporarily stopped flashing, due to a bout of low sunlight. The angle of the satellite’s orbit relative to the Sun is an indication of how much time EQUiSat spends in the Sun or in the shadow of the Earth. This angle changes over time, and so our CubeSat goes through periods of high and low sun exposure which affects the level which we can charge the batteries to and the temperature of the satellite. This angle changes over time (on the order of weeks) because of irregularities in the Earth’s gravitational field, which are themselves caused by the imperfections in the spherical shape of the planet.

<p>As you can see we’ve been in a low sunlight season for the last months of 2018, but this changed in December 2018. Since then we’ve gotten <a target="_blank" href="/assets/equisat/images/lucas_moon.png">radio</a> confirmation that we’ve started flashing again!</p>
