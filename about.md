I'm Zachary Nado, a Research Engineer at [Google Brain](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/){:target="_blank"} in Cambridge, MA.  I'm interested in how to accelerate deep learning training with better algorithms, hyperparameter tuning, and other tricks! I love basically anything with artificial intelligence, cats, and/or space.

I graduated with honors from Brown University with a B.S. in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics in 2016 where I worked at the [Serre Lab](http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu){:target="_blank"} for four years.  There I worked on various systems engineering problems for the lab, lead a team of six to design a web annotation tool for labelling and viewing machine learning data, and developed my [honors thesis](https://cs.brown.edu/research/pubs/theses/ugrad/2016/nado.zachary.pdf){:target="_blank"} which replaced an older computer vision pipeline for classifying mouse behavior with convolutional neural networks.

During my college summers I did two internships with Google where I worked on several search infrastructure projects, one of which was launched as a web search to Android integration where you could send directions to your phone from the web.  These summers were followed by an internship at [SpaceX](http://www.spacex.com){:target="_blank"} as part of their software engineering team where I managed to say "hi" to Elon Musk and watch the launch of the only rocket they've had explode mid flight.

I was also a member of the [Brown Space Engineering team](http://brownspace.org){:target="_blank"} for three years where I worked on our first ever satellite, a 1U cubesat that acts as an artificial shooting star that will be launched to orbit in May 2018.

Before that I was a captain and programming lead for my high school [FIRST robotics team FRC2168](https://team2168.org){:target="_blank"}.
